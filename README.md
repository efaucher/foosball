# Rules for Foosball
## 1. Start of a Match  
1.1 A coin flip shall precede the start of the match. The team that wins the flip has the choice of table side. The team that loses the flip has the remaining option.

1.2 Once a team has chosen either the table side, they may not change their decision.

1.3 In the event of the loser's bracket winner beating the winner's bracket team in the first match, the second match will be started in the same manner as a regular match with the coin flip, etc.

1.4 The match officially starts once the ball has been put into play.

## 2. The Serve
2.1 A serve through the serving hole is used to put the ball into play at the start of the match, after a point is scored, after a ball leaves the table or if the ball is in play and is deemed unplayable.

2.2 The play area shall be defined as the area above the playing surface to the height of the side boards of the cabinet.

2.3 The first player to touch the ball in the serve is called the serving player. No goal can be scored during the serve until another player figure from a rod other than the 5-man rod of the serving player has touched the ball.  

2.4 The server must not serve the ball until he has the assurance that the opposing team is ready for play to begin. The server can signify that play is about to begin by tapping the ball on the side of the table.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4.1 If the server has tapped the ball, and the opposing team is holding their handles, the opposing team shall be deemed to be ready for play (unless they have specially stated before the ball hits the playing surface that they are not ready yet).
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4.2 If the ball is incorrectly served, but the server has not violated any part of these rules, the ball is considered in play. In particular, the player may not reach into the play area to re-serve the ball (see 11).
   
## 3. Ball in Play  
Once a ball is put into play by the server (see 2), it shall remain in play until the ball is hit off the table, a dead ball is declared, or a point is scored.

## 4. Ball Off the Table  
If the ball should leave the playing area and strike the scoring marker, ash trays, top of the side rails, cabinet ends, or any object that is not a part of the table, the ball shall be declared off the table. The ball should be put back into play with a serve by any team.

4.1 A ball entering the serving cup and then returning to the playfield is still considered "in play." 

## 5. Dead Ball
A ball shall be declared a dead ball when it has completely stopped its motion and is not within reach of any player figure.

5.1 If the ball is declared dead, it must be removed from play by a player and served back by the same player (see 2).

5.2 A ball that is spinning in place is not considered to be a dead ball.

## 6. Point Scored
A ball entering the goal shall count as a point, as long as it was legally scored. A ball which enters the goal but returns to the playing surface and/or leaves the table still counts as a goal.

6.1 If a point is not counted on the scoring markers and both teams agree that it was previously scored and inadvertently not marked up, the point shall count. If both teams do not agree that a point was scored and not marked up, after another ball is scored, that point shall not be counted.

6.2 If there is a controversy over whether or not the ball entered the goal, an official should be called.

6.3 Any team intentionally marking up a point not scored shall not get credit for the point illegally marked up and shall be charged with a technical foul. Further violations of this rule will be grounds for forfeiture of game or match (to be determined by the Head Official).

## 7. Table Sides
At the end of each game, teams must switch sides of the table before play of the next game can begin. A maximum of 60 seconds is allowed between games.

7.1 Either team can request the full 60 seconds. If both teams acknowledge that they are ready to resume play before the full time is used, play shall continue and the remainder of that 60 seconds is then forfeited.

7.2 If a team is not ready to play at the end of the 60 second period, that team shall be charged with delay of game. 

## 8. Change of Positions
In any doubles event, each player may play only the two rods normally designated for his position. Once the ball is put into play, the players must play the same position until a point is scored or a technical is called.

8.1 Either team may switch positions during a time out, between points, between games, or before and/or after a technical foul shot.

8.2 Once a team has switched positions, they may not switch back until after the ball has been put back into play or another time out has been called.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.2.1 A team is considered to have switched positions once both players are in their respective places facing the table.

8.3 Illegally switching positions while the ball is in play will be judged a distraction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.3.1 In any doubles event any player placing their hand on any rod normally designated as one played by their partner while the ball is in play shall be judged as a distraction violations.

## 9. Spinning the Rods
Spinning of the rods is illegal. Spinning is defined as the rotation of any soccer figure more than 360 degrees before or after striking the ball. In calculating the 360 degrees, you do not add the degrees spun prior to striking the ball to the degrees spun after striking the ball.

9.1 A ball which is advanced by an illegal spin is replayed as follows: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*If the ball goes in the goal,* then it will not be counted as a point and will be served back.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*If the ball does not go in the goal,* the opposing team will have the option of continuing play from the current position or re-serving the ball.

9.2 Spinning of a rod which does not strike the ball does not constitute an illegal spin.

9.3 If a player's spinning rod hits the ball backwards into his own goal, it will count as a goal for the opposing team. 

9.4 Spinning of a rod away from the ball (when there is no possession) is not considered an illegal spin, but may be ruled as a distraction.

# 10. Jarring
Any jarring, sliding, or lifting of the table shall be illegal. Whether or not the table jarring is done intentionally is of no consequence. This call must be made by an official. It is not necessary for a player to lose the ball for jarring to be called on his opponent.

10.1 The penalty for violation of this rule:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*First offense* - the opposing team has the option of continuing play from the current position, continuing play from the point of infraction, or re-serving the ball. If an illegal jar causes the player to lose possession of the ball from a rod, play may be continued from that rod.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Subsequent violations* - Technical foul. After the technical shot, the non offending team continues to have the options listed under First Offense (10.1).
        
10.2 Touching or coming into contact with your opponent's rods in any way shall be penalized exactly like jarring, sliding, or lifting.

10.3 Jarring of the table may be called even if the ball is not in play. In particular, slamming the rod after the shot may be considered jarring.

# 11. Reaching Into the Playing Area
It is illegal for a player to reach into the play area while the ball is in play without first having permission from the opposing team, whether he touches the ball or not. However, whenever the opposing team grants a player permission to reach into the playing area, it is legal for the player to do so.

11.1 A spinning ball is considered "in-play," even if it is not in reach of a player figure. It is illegal to reach into playing area to stop a spinning ball, even if done for an opponent.

11.2 A ball which becomes airborne over the table is still in play until it has hit something not a part of the playing area. Do not catch a flying ball over the table.

11.3 A ball which has gone dead is considered out of play. The ball may be freely touched once permission has been granted by the official, or if no official is present, by the opposing team.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no penalty for touching the ball after it is dead, regardless of whether or not permission was given to touch the ball.

11.4 A player may wipe shot marks off any part of the table while the ball is not in play. He does not need to ask permission of the opposing team.

11.5 The penalty for violation of this rule is as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*If the player has possession of the ball, and the ball is stopped* - loss of possession to the opposing team.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*If the ball is moving in the player's goal area behind the two-man rod* - a point is scored for the opposing team, and the ball is re-served as if it had gone in the goal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Any other case* - technical foul. 

# 12. Distractions
Any movement or sound made away from the rod where the ball is in play may be judged as a distraction. No point made as a result of a distraction will count. If a player believes he is being distracted, it is his responsibility to call for an official.

# 13. Match Time Limit
13.1 A game is considered the first team to five points.

13.2 A match is considered a best of three games.

13.3 Best of three matches shall be limited to 20 minutes from the time the match is started.

13.4 If the specified time limit expires before the match has been completed, an official will announce to the players that a ten minute overtime period will begin at that time. If the overtime period ends before the match has been completed, the winner of the match shall be the player or team which has won the most games, or if the teams have an equal number of games, it shall be the team that has scored the most points in the game in progress, after the ball in play at this time that the overtime period expires has been scored. If the teams have won an equal number of games and scored an equal number of points after this ball has been scored, one more ball shall be played to determine the winner of the match.

# 14. Delay of Game
Play shall be continuous, except during time outs. A delay of game penalty may only be called by an official.

# 15. Forfeiture
Once a match has been called, both teams should report immediately to the designated table. If a team has not reported to the table within three minutes, they should be recalled. A team, upon being recalled, must report immediately to the table in order to stop the forfeiture process.

15.1 Penalty for second and subsequent recalls is forfeiture of a game.
